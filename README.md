# Smart-Oral-Health-Monitor

Many people neglect daily dental care and only visit the dentist when a serious issue arises. To address this, we have developed a smart device designed to detect dental problems, such as cavities, plaque buildup, mouth ulcers and gum issues at an early stage. By providing real-time insights into oral health, this device encourages proactive dental care, helping individuals maintain better oral hygiene and prevent complications before they require professional treatment.
